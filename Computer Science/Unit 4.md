# Section 7 - Data structures
## 82 - Collection data types
### These include:
- Arrays
- Records
- Lists
- Tuples
Note: all of these are **ordered collections of items**
### Data types vs data structures
- **Data type:** 
	- what a variable can contain
	- a class of concrete items that share a property
- **Data structure:** 
	- a collection of types/forms of data
	- a way of organising/accessing data
	- an abstraction on top of data types

| Feature            | Array   | Record  | Lists   | Tuples    |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| **Static/dynamic** | Static  | Static  | Dynamic | Static    |
| **Mutability**     | Mutable | Mutable | Mutable | Immutable |
| **Item type**      | Same    | Any     | Any     | Any       |

Notes:
- Mutability means that the individual items can be 
- Static means known at **compile-time**, dynamic means known at **run-time**.

### Keywords
- Arrays: **contiguous** memory
- All: have a **single identifier**.
